Configure your HMD and preset
=======

1. Open `SteamVR Dashboard` and open the ReShade Settings (circle Reshade icon in the bottom of the dashboard)
2. Un-tick `"Performance Mode"` checkbox to see the settings of the VRToolkit
3. Use your VR pointer to Adjust the `"Circle Radius"` matching your HMD field of view sweet spot and to your personal view range.
    - Keep the radius as small as possible, but as well not to small to not loose sharpness.
4. **Optional:** Change sharpening mode and color correction mode + settings to your liking.
   Hover over the `(?) Usage Help (?)` for selectable modes.
5. Re-enable `"Performance Mode"` when done
