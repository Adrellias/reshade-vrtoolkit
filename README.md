The VRToolkit is a modular shader created for [ReShade](https://github.com/crosire/reshade) 
to enhance the clarity & sharpness in VR to get most out of your HMD while keeping the performance impact minimal.

### Main Features

- Sharpening Modes for enhanced clarity while only processing the pixels that are in the sweep spot of your HMD
- Color Correction Modes to be able to adjust your HMD colors & contrast to your liking
- Dithering to reduce banding effects of gradients and sharpening artifacts
- All modules are processed in a single render pass post shader to improve performance instead of having them all separate

*Note: ReShade currently only works on games run through SteamVR. (OpenVR API)*
